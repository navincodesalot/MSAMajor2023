# Flask Project Tutorial
This directory contains a python flask project that gets blog post data from an sqlite database and allows a user to view, create, update, and delete blog posts.

There is documentation in the templates folder that explains the templating system and the template elements available that make producing dynamic content possible

The `app.py` file contains the backend code that runs the app. Explanation of the file is done with the comments in the file

## Directions
- View the `app.py file` first to understand the code. 
- Next, you should review the documentation in the templates folder to learn about templating

## Run the code
- Run the init_db.py file to produce the database `python init_db.py`
- Run `python app.py` to start the flask server to view the application. The project will be visible on `localhost:5000` localhost, port 5000.
