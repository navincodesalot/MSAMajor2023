# Stock Visualizer Challenge

You will create a python application that queries the Alpha Vantage api, and allows the user to select a date range to view the data, and the type of chart they want to view the data in.

## Requirements

The application should:

- Ask the user to enter the stock symbol for the company they want data for.
- Ask the user for the chart type they would like.
- Ask the user for the time series function they want the api to use.
- Ask the user for the beginning date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Ask the user for the end date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
  - The end date should not be before the begin date
- Generate a graph and open in the userâ€™s default browser.
